## Course Meeting Times

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

## Prerequisites

([*8.02 Physics II: Electricity And Magnetism*](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/8-02-physics-ii-electricity-and-magnetism-spring-2007/) or *8.021 Physics II: Electricity And Magnetism* or [*8.022 Physics II: Electricity And Magnetism*](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/8-022-physics-ii-electricity-and-magnetism-fall-2004/)) and ([*18.03 Differential Equations*](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-03sc-differential-equations-fall-2011/) or *18.032 Differential Equations*)

Knowledge of ordinary differential equations is essential. Some linear algebra (knowledge of eigenvectors and eigenvalues) is also necessary. Having some experience with numerical computation is helpful but not necessary.

## Course Description

This course provides an introduction to nonlinear dynamics and chaos in dissipative systems. The content is structured to be of general interest to undergraduates in science and engineering. 

The course concentrates on simple models of dynamical systems, mathematical theory underlying their behavior, their relevance to natural phenomena, and methods of data analysis and interpretation. The emphasis is on nonlinear phenomena that may be described by a few variables that evolve with time.

To promote the notion of numerical experiments, we assign several laboratory-like problem sets that involve numerical simulation of dynamical systems. Python and Matlab code will often be provided, but students are free to use whatever tools they desire.

## Requirements

There are no exams.

There are ten problem sets, assigned usually once per week, but occasionally less frequently. Some problems will be analytical while others will require use of a computer. The problem sets must be completed and turned in on time for grading. Requests for extensions in exceptional circumstances must be made in advance.

Students are also required to complete a final project and briefly present their work during the final meeting of the class. A written report is also due at that time. The final project could be either an analysis of an interesting paper or topic in the scientific literature, an attempt of your own to apply what you have learned to your own interests, or a combination of the two.

## Grading

Problems sets count for about 80% of the grade and the final project about 20%.
